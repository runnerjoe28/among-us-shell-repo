Note that some elements were not installed or they have created errors. These errors should be accuracy reflected in the terminal output and should clearly indicate areas where installations failed. Some reasons for failure could include, but are not limited to:

	* No internet connection
	* Outside web services being unavailable
	* A unique version of linux being used without many standard configurations
	* Errors with the script itself
